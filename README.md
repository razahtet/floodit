# Flood It
- A Game where you have to flood the board with one color at the end before you run out of moves.
- Click on a square to "flood" the board with that color's square. 
- Press "r" to reset the board/game
- Press "c" to change the number of colors in the game, which would restart the game with the new number of colors in the game. (3-8 colors)
- Press "s" to change the size of the board, which would restart the game with the new size of the board. (sizes: 9, 10, 14, 20, 22, 24, 28)
- Press "h" to enable hints, where the computer finds the best color to click next to win with the fewest number of moves using the greedy approach.
- The hints are only available for game board sizes of 10 or less, and the # of colors being 5 or less due to time and space complexity.
